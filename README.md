# React GraphQL Movie App
And app that uses an open movie app to get data for the top upcoming / now showing films.

This app was built on July 14th and as of July 15th is hosted
at (https://safe-fjord-10121.herokuapp.com/).

### App A Day
I am challenging myself to develop and deploy React Apps with Node backend in under 24 hours at least once per week.

This app is the first of the series.

As of this app, the apps are not built from a template, with just using npm and create-react-app for framework and libraries.
